This project leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve complex differential equations in linear elasticity. The model is designed to compute displacements and stress tensors at every point on a 2D object of arbitrary shape subjected to position-dependent body forces. By integrating physics-based constraints into the neural network framework, this approach provides an efficient and accurate solution for elasticity problems.
